This Project contains location and locationserver as required
Lab 1 formarly passes however due to upgrades and modifications made for later labs no longer does
Lab 2 passes all tests
Lab 3 passses all tests
Lab 4 passes all tests except Test 27
Lab 5 passes all tests at thread level 50
Lab 6 Passes for sections relating to the log file however fails in regards to the database

To the best of my knowledge I have implemented all features required however a note:
My server saves its database as the server closes rather than dynamically during runtime.

Included in the file list is the following images that show the designs for my GUI:

locationserverGUI.png

My GUI has not been completed due to issues with implmenting windows forms however I have included the designs as mentioned above to show the concept.
