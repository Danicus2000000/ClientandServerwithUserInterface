This Project contains location and locationserver as required
Lab 1 passes however due to upgrades and modifications made for later labs no longer does
Lab 2 passes all tests for server side
Lab 3 passses all tests for client side
Lab 4 passes all tests except Test 27 for server side
Lab 5 passes all tests at custom thread level 50 for test 3
Lab 6 Passes for sections relating to the log file however fails in regards to the database

To the best of my knowledge I have implemented all features required howeve a note:
My server saves its database as the server closes rather than dynamically during runtime

Included in the file list is the following images that show the designs for my GUI:

My GUI is not completed however the design shows my ideas.
